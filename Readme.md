In the heart of Alberta, the menace of wildfires poses a significant challenge. With their
unpredictable impact and severity, these fires threaten the natural landscapes,
communities, wildlife, and the economy. In response to this pressing issue, the Alberta Fire
Department has accepted our project proposal to help them.

Your primary objective is to develop innovative strategies for predicting wildfires' size class
across different Alberta regions based on data regarding their initial conditions.
To help the province of Alberta better understand the risk profile to make an effective
strategy and decision to mitigate the wildfire risk, help save lives and property, and protect
indigenous areas, you are assigned the Data Scientist role to help with the below questions
using statistical analysis together with AI/ML.

1.Which top FSA regions are more vulnerable to Wildfires?
What are the main reasons that usually cause the wildfires near each vulnerable FSA
region? It will also analyze the main reasons for the wildfires with large burn areas and
the much more significant impact on the environment and residents nearby.
2.Assess the population's vulnerability in each vulnerable FSA region and identify the
wildfires' impact on the indigenous population. (For more demographic information, you
can go to Statistics Canada.)
3.Create the AI/ML models to predict the severity of wildfires and the final size of the
fires.
4.Tips for success: We encourage conducting additional research to find the third-party data
that you think is useful to resolve the problems. In the final submission, you must clearly
explain the thought process of the methodologies used logically and combine the data
visualization tools with AI/ML models to extract the key insights and interpret the results in
plain business language.
Guidelines for report
Maximum 5 pages (excluding references), minimum font size 11. (Not following this
formatting standard will receive a score deduction)
Your report should include these sections:
Introduction: Introduce the background, previous research and applications of this
topic, its value proposition (i.e., project objective as to why this use case is relevant or
essential to some specific sectors), and the structure of the rest of the paper to tackle
the use case. You should also clearly mention and interpret the assumptions and
hypothesis if there are any.
Methodology: This section describes how you plan to tackle this use case in detail.
Break this section into logical sub-sections that present your methodologies clearly and
concisely. (e.g., how the data is integrated, criteria to define the most vulnerable FSA,
criteria to derive the vulnerable population profile, models used for prediction, etc.)Flow
charts, figures and tables can be added to help with interpretation. You only need to
show some of the mathematical details or proofs but convey the fundamental concepts
of the data science methodologies in plain language. Do not include code samples in the
report; attach them to the final submission package.
Experiments & Results: This section demonstrates the experimentation design & results
to showcase the capabilities (and limitations) of this use case by exploring the provided
datasets and the methodologies being considered. Describe the experiments and relate
them to the objective of this use case.
Conclusion: Provide a report summary and restate the project's relevance.
Demonstrate the areas of future enhancement.
References: List all the references you used and other sources the reader may follow (if
applicable).
